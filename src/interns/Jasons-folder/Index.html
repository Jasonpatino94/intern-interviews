    <p>Hello, My name is Jason Patino and as I begin my search for an internship, I would like to direct my focus toward both adapting to a corporate environment as well as building my technical skills. 
    I look forward to working on a technical team and further building my collaboration skills. In addition to this, I am excited to apply and build my technical skills that I have acquired through coding bootcamp. 
    I aspire to be a software engineer because I enjoy the process of fixing and building projects.  I have a non traditional background where my last  trade was as a car mechanic which included fixing cars, very different at a high level. 
    However, I find myself approaching problems in bootcamp the same way I did as a mechanic: trying different solutions until I found the most efficient and effective method. I really enjoy the full stack aspect in software engineering. 
    From coming up with the data in the backend, to making everything look organized in the frontend.</p>
